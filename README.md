# StellarLock

Token and LP liquidity lock platform built on [Stellar Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org). Lock tokens or LP pool shares in an immutable on-chain contract, then share a public verifiable link so your community knows the liquidity can't be rugged.

## Features

- **Token locks** — lock any SEP-41 token until a chosen date, with optional linear vesting
- **LP locks** — lock Aquarius or Soroswap pool share tokens
- **Public explorer** — anyone can verify locks by token contract address
- **Extend locks** — creators can extend the unlock date, never shorten it
- **Beneficiary model** — creator and beneficiary can be different addresses (vesting, team grants)
- **Freighter wallet** integration

## Live Contracts (Testnet)

| Contract | Address |

| LP Locker | `CA3WYETNIF5IAF3VUNQ3SYKZFV45TOFBF7CEZ46I7QEBPWTRM73WLEI4` |

## Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Smart contracts | Rust / Soroban SDK 22 |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) — `npm install -g pnpm`
- [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app) browser extension set to **Testnet**

### Environments

Three environment templates are provided:

| File | Network | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `.env.testnet` | Soroban Testnet | Local development and CI |
| `.env.staging` | Mainnet (staging contracts) | QA / pre-production sign-off |
| `.env.mainnet` | Mainnet | Production |

Copy the template for the environment you want to use:

```bash
cp .env.testnet .env   # testnet (default)
cp .env.staging .env   # staging
cp .env.mainnet .env   # mainnet
```

Or use the pnpm scripts, which copy automatically before starting:

```bash
pnpm dev              # uses existing .env
pnpm dev:testnet      # copies .env.testnet then starts Vite
pnpm dev:staging      # copies .env.staging then starts Vite

pnpm build            # uses existing .env
pnpm build:testnet    # copies .env.testnet then builds
pnpm build:staging    # copies .env.staging then builds
pnpm build:mainnet    # copies .env.mainnet then builds
```

#### Required variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `VITE_NETWORK` | `testnet`, `staging`, or `mainnet` |
| `VITE_RPC_URL` | Soroban RPC endpoint |
| `VITE_HORIZON_URL` | Horizon REST endpoint |
| `VITE_TOKEN_LOCKER_CONTRACT` | Deployed token locker contract ID |
| `VITE_LP_LOCKER_CONTRACT` | Deployed LP locker contract ID |
| `VITE_CONTRACT_ENV` | `testnet` or `mainnet` — selects addresses from `contracts/registry.json` |
| `VITE_CONTRACT_VERSION` | Contract version, e.g. `v1` |

Optional: `VITE_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN`, `VITE_PLAUSIBLE_API_HOST`, `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`, `VITE_APP_URL`.

The app validates all required variables at startup and throws a clear error listing any that are missing — the page will not load until they are set.

#### Environment badge

A `DEV` (blue) or `STAGING` (amber) badge appears in the Navbar header when `VITE_NETWORK` is not `mainnet`. The badge is invisible in production builds.

### Run locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev:testnet
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Docker (alternative)

A fully containerised dev environment is available for contributors who don't want to install Node.js, pnpm, Rust, or the Soroban CLI locally.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 24+
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) v2 (bundled with Docker Desktop)

#### Start the frontend dev server

```bash
# Copy the testnet environment template first
cp .env.testnet .env

# Build the image and start Vite (hot-reload enabled)
docker-compose up frontend
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). Any code change you make on your host machine is reflected immediately thanks to the source-tree volume mount.

#### Build Soroban contracts

```bash
docker-compose run --rm contracts build
```

Compiled WASMs land in `contracts/target/wasm32v1-none/release/`.

#### Run Rust contract tests

```bash
docker-compose run --rm contracts test
```

This runs `cargo test` inside the contracts workspace with the full Rust + Soroban SDK environment.

#### Docker files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Dockerfile.dev` | Frontend — Node 20 + pnpm, dependency layer caching |
| `Dockerfile.contracts` | Contracts — Rust + Soroban CLI |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Orchestrates both services |
| `.dockerignore` | Excludes `node_modules`, `target`, build artifacts, and secrets |

### Build

```bash
pnpm build:mainnet
```

## Smart Contracts

### Build

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs) and the [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/stellar-cli).

```bash
cd contracts
stellar contract build
```

Compiled WASMs land in `contracts/target/wasm32v1-none/release/`.

### Deploy

```bash
# Create and fund a testnet account
stellar keys generate myaccount --network testnet
stellar keys fund myaccount --network testnet

# Deploy both contracts
cd contracts
./deploy.sh myaccount
```

Paste the printed contract IDs into `src/lib/stellar.ts` under `CONTRACTS`.

### Monitoring

- Visit `/health` for a lightweight browser-facing status page.
- Monitor `/api/health` for a structured JSON payload and `/api/readiness` for readiness checks.
- External analytics and font assets use SRI and crossorigin attributes where supported.

### Contract API

#### Token Locker

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `create_lock(creator, token, amount, beneficiary, unlock_at, vesting?)` | Lock tokens, returns lock id |
| `withdraw(id)` | Beneficiary withdraws after unlock |
| `extend(id, new_unlock_at)` | Creator extends unlock date |
| `get_lock(id)` | Fetch a single lock |
| `get_locks_by_creator(address)` | All locks created by address |
| `get_locks_by_beneficiary(address)` | All locks where address is beneficiary |
| `get_locks_by_token(token)` | All locks for a token (powers the explorer) |
| `init(admin)` | Set admin once after deployment |
| `propose_upgrade(wasm_hash)` | Queue a WASM upgrade (7-day timelock) |
| `execute_upgrade()` | Apply upgrade after timelock elapses |
| `cancel_upgrade()` | Cancel a pending upgrade |

#### LP Locker

Same shape as Token Locker, minus vesting, plus `dex`, `token_a`, `token_b` fields. Shares the same `init`, `propose_upgrade`, `execute_upgrade`, `cancel_upgrade` API.

## Upgrade Policy

Both contracts implement an **admin upgrade with a 7-day timelock**.

- Immutability is the default — no admin means no upgrades.
- After deployment, call `init(admin)` once to register an admin. If `init` is never called, the contract is permanently immutable.
- When an upgrade is needed, the admin calls `propose_upgrade(new_wasm_hash)`. The proposal is stored on-chain with an `execute_after` timestamp 7 days in the future.
- Anyone can observe the pending proposal on-chain during the 7-day window.
- After 7 days, the admin calls `execute_upgrade()` to apply the new WASM. All persistent lock state is preserved across upgrades.
- The admin can call `cancel_upgrade()` at any time to abort a pending proposal.
- All upgrade events (`upgrade_proposed`, `upgrade_cancelled`) are emitted on-chain.

| Function | Who | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `init(admin)` | deployer (once) | Sets the admin address |
| `propose_upgrade(wasm_hash)` | admin | Queues upgrade, 7-day delay |
| `execute_upgrade()` | admin | Applies upgrade after delay |
| `cancel_upgrade()` | admin | Cancels pending proposal |

> The upgrade path exists solely for critical security fixes. User lock funds are held in persistent storage and are unaffected by WASM upgrades.
