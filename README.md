# StellarLock

Token and LP liquidity lock platform built on [Stellar Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org). Lock tokens or LP pool shares in an immutable on-chain contract, then share a public verifiable link so your community knows the liquidity can't be rugged.

## Features

- **Token locks** — lock any SEP-41 token until a chosen date, with optional linear vesting
- **LP locks** — lock Aquarius or Soroswap pool share tokens
- **Split locks** — create atomic multi-beneficiary locks (2–10 beneficiaries) in a single transaction with proportional shares
- **Public explorer** — anyone can verify locks by token contract address
- **Extend locks** — creators can extend the unlock date, never shorten it
- **Beneficiary model & transfer** — creator and beneficiary can be different addresses (vesting, team grants) with beneficiary transfer support
- **Emergency pause & admin safety** — circuit breaker pause and two-step admin transfer protection
- **Freighter wallet** integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 22 (see `.nvmrc` — managed automatically by `nvm`, `fnm`, etc.)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) — `npm install -g pnpm`
- [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app) browser extension set to **Testnet**

### Environments

Three environment templates are provided:

| File | Network | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `.env.testnet` | Soroban Testnet | Local development and CI |
| `.env.staging` | Mainnet (staging contracts) | QA / pre-production sign-off |
| `.env.mainnet` | Mainnet | Production |

Copy the template for the environment you want to use:

```bash
cp .env.testnet .env   # testnet (default)
cp .env.staging .env   # staging
cp .env.mainnet .env   # mainnet
```

Or use the pnpm scripts, which copy automatically before starting:

```bash
pnpm dev              # uses existing .env
pnpm dev:testnet      # copies .env.testnet then starts Vite
pnpm dev:staging      # copies .env.staging then starts Vite

pnpm build            # uses existing .env
pnpm build:testnet    # copies .env.testnet then builds
pnpm build:staging    # copies .env.staging then builds
pnpm build:mainnet    # copies .env.mainnet then builds
```

#### Required variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `VITE_NETWORK` | `testnet`, `staging`, or `mainnet` |
| `VITE_RPC_URL` | Soroban RPC endpoint |
| `VITE_HORIZON_URL` | Horizon REST endpoint |
| `VITE_TOKEN_LOCKER_CONTRACT` | Deployed token locker contract ID |
| `VITE_LP_LOCKER_CONTRACT` | Deployed LP locker contract ID |
| `VITE_CONTRACT_ENV` | `testnet` or `mainnet` — selects addresses from `contracts/registry.json` |
| `VITE_CONTRACT_VERSION` | Contract version, e.g. `v1` |

Optional: `VITE_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN`, `VITE_PLAUSIBLE_API_HOST`, `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`, `VITE_APP_URL`.

The app validates all required variables at startup and throws a clear error listing any that are missing — the page will not load until they are set.

#### Environment badge

A `DEV` (blue) or `STAGING` (amber) badge appears in the Navbar header when `VITE_NETWORK` is not `mainnet`. The badge is invisible in production builds.

### Run locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev:testnet
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Docker (alternative)

A fully containerised dev environment is available for contributors who don't want to install Node.js, pnpm, Rust, or the Soroban CLI locally.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 24+
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) v2 (bundled with Docker Desktop)

#### Start the frontend dev server

```bash
# Copy the testnet environment template first
cp .env.testnet .env

# Build the image and start Vite (hot-reload enabled)
docker-compose up frontend
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). Any code change you make on your host machine is reflected immediately thanks to the source-tree volume mount.

#### Build Soroban contracts

```bash
docker-compose run --rm contracts build
```

Compiled WASMs land in `contracts/target/wasm32v1-none/release/`.

#### Run Rust contract tests

```bash
docker-compose run --rm contracts test
```

This runs `cargo test` inside the contracts workspace with the full Rust + Soroban SDK environment.

#### Run the indexer and notification worker

```bash
docker-compose --profile backend up indexer notifier
```

Both share a SQLite index on the `indexer-data` volume. See [Indexer & notification worker](#indexer--notification-worker) for the required environment variables.

#### Docker files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Dockerfile.dev` | Frontend — Node 22 + pnpm, dependency layer caching |
| `Dockerfile.contracts` | Contracts — Rust + Soroban CLI |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Orchestrates the frontend, contracts, indexer and notifier services |
| `.dockerignore` | Excludes `node_modules`, `target`, build artifacts, and secrets |

### Build

```bash
pnpm build:mainnet
```

### Indexer & notification worker

`/api/indexer-*` and the notification-subscription feature read a SQLite index that is kept up to date by two long-running Node processes. Run each one in its own terminal:

```bash
pnpm indexer:start    # polls Soroban contract events into the index (every INDEXER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS, default 10s)
pnpm notifier:start   # sends 7d / 1d / at-unlock reminders (every NOTIFIER_INTERVAL_MS, default 1h)
```

See [docs/indexer-architecture.md](docs/indexer-architecture.md) for event idempotency, cursor recovery, and release accounting details.

| Variable | Used by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `LOCK_INDEX_DB_PATH` | both, and `api/` | SQLite file path (default `lock-index.sqlite`). Must be the same file for every process. |
| `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` | indexer | RPC endpoint (default testnet) |
| `TOKEN_LOCKER_CONTRACT`, `LP_LOCKER_CONTRACT` | indexer | Contracts to index. At least one is required. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` | notifier | Email delivery. Emails are skipped if the key is unset. |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | notifier | HMAC key for the `X-StellarLock-Signature` header |

## Smart Contracts

### Build

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs) and the [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/stellar-cli).

```bash
cd contracts
stellar contract build
```

Compiled WASMs land in `contracts/target/wasm32v1-none/release/`.

### Deploy

```bash
# Create and fund a testnet account
stellar keys generate myaccount --network testnet
stellar keys fund myaccount --network testnet

# Deploy both contracts
cd contracts
./deploy.sh myaccount
```

Paste the printed contract IDs into `src/lib/stellar.ts` under `CONTRACTS`.

### Monitoring

- Visit `/health` for a lightweight browser-facing status page.
- Monitor `/api/health` for a structured JSON payload and `/api/readiness` for readiness checks.
- External analytics and font assets use SRI and crossorigin attributes where supported.

## Upgrade Policy

Both contracts implement an **admin upgrade with a 7-day timelock**.

- Immutability is the default — no admin means no upgrades.
- After deployment, call `init(admin)` once to register an admin. If `init` is never called, the contract is permanently immutable.
- When an upgrade is needed, the admin calls `propose_upgrade(new_wasm_hash)`. The proposal is stored on-chain with an `execute_after` timestamp 7 days in the future.
- Anyone can observe the pending proposal on-chain during the 7-day window.
- After 7 days, the admin calls `execute_upgrade()` to apply the new WASM. All persistent lock state is preserved across upgrades.
- The admin can call `cancel_upgrade()` at any time to abort a pending proposal.
- All upgrade events (`upgrade_proposed`, `upgrade_cancelled`) are emitted on-chain.

Admin ownership can be transferred without changing the upgrade timelock. The current admin first nominates a replacement with `propose_admin(new_admin)`. The nominated address must authenticate a separate `accept_admin()` call; only then does it become the admin. Until acceptance, the current admin remains active. `get_admin()` returns the current admin, or `None` before initialization.

| Function | Who | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `init(admin)` | deployer (once) | Sets the admin address |
| `get_admin()` | anyone | Returns the current admin, if initialized |
| `propose_admin(new_admin)` | current admin | Stores a pending admin nomination |
| `accept_admin()` | pending admin | Completes the two-step transfer and clears the pending nomination |
| `propose_upgrade(wasm_hash)` | admin | Queues upgrade, 7-day delay |
| `execute_upgrade()` | admin | Applies upgrade after delay |
| `cancel_upgrade()` | admin | Cancels pending proposal |
| `pause()` | admin | Blocks lock lifecycle writes until `unpause()` |
| `unpause()` | admin | Restores normal lock lifecycle writes |

`pause()` and `unpause()` are emergency controls on each contract independently. While paused, non-admin write operations such as lock creation, withdrawal, extension, and beneficiary transfer fail with `ContractPaused`; read-only queries and admin/governance functions remain available. A pending upgrade can still execute after its timelock, so operators should cancel an unsafe pending upgrade separately. See [docs/incident-response.md](docs/incident-response.md) for the response workflow.

> The upgrade path exists solely for critical security fixes. User lock funds are held in persistent storage and are unaffected by WASM upgrades.
